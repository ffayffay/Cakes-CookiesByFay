<!-- ==================== ABOUT =========================== -->
		<div id="about" class="about-sec-wrap">
			<h1 class="title">A little about me...</h1>
			<p class="about-text-wrap">
				I've had a strong interest and love of baking since being a child. I started my bakery career at the age of 17 working at a local neighborhood bakery. I quickly took interest in decorating cookies whenever I had any down time. The owner took notice of my interest and talent and started teaching me to decorate cakes. The bakery soon hired a new cake decorator with decades of experience and she took me under her wing and I owe much of what I know to her sharing her knowledge with me. I enjoyed 7 years at this bakery but eventually moved on, had a handful of non bakery jobs but soon found myself craving to once again be decorating. I found a job in Louisville at a similar traditionally bakery and got the opportunity to further grow my cookie decorating skills. I spent 3 years there in charge of the cookie decorating portion of the bakery and in that time have decorated tens of thousands of cookies. I have enjoyed most of the time I've worked for others at these public bakeries but I've also seen a lot that I don't approve of and because of this I am very passionate about making cakes, cookies, and other baked goods from scratch with quality ingredients! I love being apart of making people happy and furthering to add to the enjoyment of birthdays, weddings, and other special occasions. It's this that brings me to where I am now in life and my career and why I hope you give me the opportunity to add to your special occasion.
